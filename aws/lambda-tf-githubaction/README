The POC has 2 folders
infra : it has the followings files
 api-gateway.tf : terraform manifest regarding api-gateway, You can see all resources that we are using to this POC
 iam.tf : terraform manifest regarding iam resources with lambda function
 lambda.tf : terraform manifest with all resources required to create a lambda function
 main.tf : terraform manifest to declare the version that is going to use with aws provider
 output.tf : 


 lambda: the folder stores the code of nodejs app and the zip file to upload in aws lambda

 publish.sh : bash script that is going to be called from github action
